# NutLogger

Hi, this is a very simple logger for my Game Framework.
Well I think that Loggers don't need to be very complex. I have used Spdlog.

Had a blast using it. It is fun easy to use but, it increased my compile times by 5s, so I just made this.

If you want to use it. I would be very happy and honored.
